<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

There are official cheat built in DoL, this one will just add more cheat inside the game, that's it. i find the cheat is lacking, beside activating cheat will make feets disabled, therefore i making cheats outside the official one and different than the official, that's it.

Here's why:

- In game cheat is lacking
- Tasks you do in game is so much that you cant even handle everything.
- Activating cheat in game will make you unable to get feets

Cheat version :

1. Vanilla.
2. Plus.
3. Online version by using tampermonkey.
4. Firebase NWJS version.
